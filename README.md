# DiceRollApp
a simple react-native app which lets you always have some dice on hand

# How to run
DiceRollApp requires npm to be set up on your machine, then you can run the project after typing:
```
cd DiceRollApp  
npm install
npm start
```
After running those commands you should be able to run the app on your Android or iOS device by scanning the QR code with the Expo Go app. Alternatively, you can type 'w' in the terminal to see a desktop version of the app, however it currently has trouble correctly visualising dice.

# Features
* create custom dice
* reroll selected dice
* remove selected dice
* save your roll results for later
* change which features you want to see on the dice screen in the settings
